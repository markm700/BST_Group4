Project 7: Binary Search Tree

Description: The objective of the program be able to read in a given script and sort the information into an ADT in the from of a Binary Search Tree. The BST organizes the information from the script into a tree, in which it compares the numerical values between root and leaf, if the newest value read in from the script is greater than the root, it will be sorted to the right, creating a new leaf of the tree. In contrast, if the new value is less than the root, it will create a new leaf to the left. Because this BST does not symmetrically sort the the values of the script, there will often be an asymmetric shaped tree which leads to a varying tree height depending on the orientation of the values from the script. After the tree is built from the various roots and leaves, the program then displays the order of which the values are loaded based on either Inorder from the left leaf to the root then to the right leaf, Preorder from the root to the left leaf then to the right leaf, or Postorder from the left leaf to the right leaf then the root. Then the program will search through and find a specified valye given by the script. Then the number of values in the tree are displayed, then followed by a display of the tree height which had been calculated earlier.
